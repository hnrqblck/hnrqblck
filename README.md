## Hey! I'm Henrique, welcome to my github!  <img height="26" src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/ABSphreak/ABSphreak/master/gifs/Hi.gif">

<br>

I'm a front-end developer with a background in Visual Arts, and just completed an Honours Degree in Computer Science in Ireland. I have 2+ years of industry experience building accessible, design-focused web applications using React and TypeScript, and I'm passionate about creating interfaces that are both elegant and intuitive.

Right now, I'm deepening my skills in modern front-end development, exploring Next.js, and working on personal projects that combine my interest in design, tech, and user behavior.

ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently building: a vinyl record store with Spotify integration

ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m learning: Next.js, accessibility best practices, and performance optimization

ðŸ’¼ Looking for: front-end roles in Dublin (or remote) where I can grow into a senior developer

Letâ€™s connect!
